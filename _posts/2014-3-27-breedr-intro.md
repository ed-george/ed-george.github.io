title : Breedr - An Introduction
---


Background
----------

It is no secret, to those that know me, that I have an unhealthy obsession. An obsession that has consumed much of my freetime since the late 90's and that will no doubt to continue well into my adulthood. The obsession I refer to is, of course, the crazy world of Pokémon. To some it is a childhood memory, but to millions it is as big now as it has ever been in its near 20 year existance. It has a well established online community that continues to grow year by year.

The latest Pokémon games (X & Y), the first non-spin off Pokémon games partially in 3D, have boosted the franchise to new levels. Increasing numbers are becoming interested in the more advanced concepts and mechanics within the games. These include the [breeding mechanic](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Breeding), [EV training](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EV_training) and [shiny hunting](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shiny).

It is the breeding mechanic that interested me primarily and led to the concept of Breedr.

An Introduction
---------------

> Pokémon breeding is a method of obtaining a new Pokémon by producing and hatching an Egg.
> The new Pokémon will inherit certain traits from its parents and this can be controlled through the use of breeding items.
> Movesets, Abilities, Capture Ball and [IVs](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Individual_values) can all be passed down.
