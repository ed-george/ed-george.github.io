"Breedr Update and more"
----------

*Happy holidays to you!*

I am celebrating Christmas this year with an announcement regarding **Breedr**, my Android Application side project(s) that aim to provide high quality Android applications for various aspects of gaming with particular focus on games within the Pok√©mon series.

I am pleased to announce the launch of Breedr's website - [breedrapps.uk](http://www.breedrapps.uk) where, from here on, updates to the current Breedr projects can be found. I hope that this will allow the projects to be *kickstarted* into being completed, as many of them are in partially completed states.

In other news, I am also happy to announce a new open source project - [NotifJ](https://github.com/ed-george/NotifJ) a Java based library to allow the easy creation of Desktop notifications such as Growl Notifications. It currently supports Growl (v2.1.3) on OS X and will be extended to work with Growl for Windows.

Please feel free to contribute to this, I would love to see this project take off!

I wish you all a happy holiday period and all the best for the coming year.

Yours festively, 
 
**Ed**
