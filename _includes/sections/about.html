<div>
    Hi there! I'm Ed, an Android developer and programmer originally from Oxfordshire, UK.
<p>
    I have been programming since I was 13 years old and have a broad interest in programming languages, mobile applications and general computer science. 
<p>
    Outside of programming, you can find me playing Pok√©mon games, supporting Oxford United FC and playing with my Pomerianian.
