<div>
    Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ed, an Android developer and programmer originally from Oxfordshire, UK but now based in Nottingham.
<p>
    I have been programming since I was 13 years old and have a broad interest in mobile applications, application security and computer science in general.
<p>
    You may have found me on social media as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/{{ author.bluesky }}"><i class="fa fa-brands fa-bluesky"></i> {{ author.bluesky }}</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ author.twitter }}"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter"></i>{{ author.twitter }}</a> / <a href="https://{{ author.mastodon.server }}/@{{ author.mastodon.user }}"><i class="fa-fw fa-brands fa-mastodon"></i>{{ author.mastodon.user }}</a> / <a href="https://threads.net/{{ author.threads }}"><i class="fa-fw fa-brands fa-threads"></i>{{ author.threads }}</a> where I regularly update and muse on all things Android. Feel free to come and say 'Hello' ðŸ¥°
<p>
    In 2022 I became a Google Developer Expert in Android and have a number of relevant talks and posts available here. However, I am always looking to collaborate. Please feel free to get in contact if that is of intrest.
<p>
    Outside of Android, you can find me playing PokÃ©mon games, supporting Oxford United and playing with my Pomerianian.
