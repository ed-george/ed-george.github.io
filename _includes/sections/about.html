    Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ed, an Android developer and programmer originally from Oxfordshire, UK but now based in Nottingham.
<p>
    I have been programming since I was 13 years old and have a broad interest in mobile applications, application security and  computer science in general.
<p>
    You may have found me at <a href="http://twitter.com/{{ author.twitter }}"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter"></i>{{ author.twitter }}</a> where I regularly update and muse on all things Android. Feel free to come and say 'Hello' ðŸ¥°

<p>
    Outside of Android, you can find me playing PokÃ©mon games, supporting Oxford United and playing with my Pomerianian.
